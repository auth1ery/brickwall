<h1>why we've made brickwall</h1>

<p>we've made brickwall purely out of spite. so many companies like google and cloudflare collect your data and harvest it during verification, they also require you to be able to modify server-side code, leaving static sites with their lonely robots.txt</p>

<p>that's why we've made brickwall, an easy to set up, privacy friendly bot verification system for everyone and every kind of site. as long as your site runs HTML and exists, it works. it's purely out-of-the-box and everything happens on our end.</p>

<p>with us just uploading brickwall's files and releasing brickwall itself finally after some months of development, we have many ideas for the future.</p>

<p>this includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>forcing brickwall to be the FIRST thing that executes</li>
  <p>this sounds aggressive and a bit like something that will hurt the heck out of your site, but its for the better. it works by detecting if its a known search engine crawler the second you visit the site. if you are a search engine crawler, nothing happens to you. but if you are, you get redirected to the verification page before everything loads. so bots like <pre>curl</pre> cant, well, curl your site since all they have is server info and timestamps and server response codes.</p>
  <br>
  <li>faster and more accurate verification system</li>
  <p>the verification system is really fast.. if you don't run old hardware or an outdated browser. for the average user, it takes about 1 - 3 seconds to verify. but for old hardware and outdated browsers, it takes about 40 seconds to a minute and a half to fully verify. trust us, we tested it on an old galaxy S4. because of that, we're currently working on making the verification system more stable and more faster and more accurate.</p>
  <br>
  <li>customizable challenge pages</li>
  <p>think about it. if the verification page doesnt match your sites vibe but you still get redirected to it anyway? that might make users think they got IP logged, or got sent to a fake reCAPTCHA, or get sent to a sketchy casino website, and then stay away from your site/ we wanna earn the user's trust (and yours!) so we're making it so you can manually and directly can edit the CSS to match your site's full vibe, and let you use the basic but still powerful settings that we made.</p>
</ul>

<p>we have many ideas and security features in mind, so look out and possibly support us by sharing brickwall with some of your fellow webmasters! who knows?</p>

<p>a world without bots is coming...</p>
